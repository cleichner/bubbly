This is hardware agnostic firmware for a robot in the style of the IEEE
Micromouse. It depends only on the functions defined in hardware.h for full
control and maze solving. They are currently simulated in two programs: softbot, 
an ncurses visulation of the robots movements and textbot, which logs its
movements to stdout. Both programs read files with ASCII maze drawings to
define their worlds.

Hardware controlling code to come.
